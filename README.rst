NOTE: This is an `OASIS Open Repository <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_. See the `Governance`_ section for more information.

*Medallion* is a minimal implementation of a TAXII 2.0 Server in Python.

For more information, see `the
documentation <https://medallion.readthedocs.io/>`__ on
ReadTheDocs.

**WARNING:** *medallion* was designed as a prototype and reference
implementation of TAXII 2.0, and is not intended for production use.

*medallion* has been designed to be a simple front-end REST server providing
access to the endpoints defined in that specification.
It uses the python framework - `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.  *medallion*
depends on back-end "plugins" which handle the persistence of the TAXII data and
metadata. The TAXII specification is agnostic to what type of data a TAXII
server stores, but this will usually be STIX 2 content.

Two back-end plugins are provided with *medallion*: the Memory back-end and the
MongoDB back-end.  The Memory back-end persists data "in memory".  It is
initialized using a json file that contains TAXII data and metadata.
It is possible to save the current state of the in memory store, but this
back-end is really intended only for testing purposes.  The MongoDB backend is
somewhat more robust and makes use of a MongoDB server, installed independently.
The MongoDB back-end can only be used if the pymongo python package is
installed. An error message will result if it is used without that package.


Installation
============

The easiest way to install *medallion* is with pip::

  $ pip install medallion


Usage
=====

To run *medallion*::

    $ python medallion/scripts/run.py <config-file>

The <config_file> contains:

- configuration information for the backend plugin
- a simple user name/password dictionary

To use the Memory back-end plug, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: python

    {
        "backend": {
            "type": "memory",
            "data_file": <path to json file with initial data>
        }
    }

To use the Mongo DB back-end plug, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: python

    {
        "backend": {
            "type": "mongodb",
            "url": <Mongo DB server url>  # e.g., "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
        }
    }

*Note: A Mongo DB should be available at some URL when using the Mongo DB back-end*

A description of the Mongo DB structure expected by the mongo db backend code is
described in `the documentation
<https://medallion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mongodb_schema.html>`_.

As required by the TAXII specification, *medallion* supports HTTP Basic
authorization.  However, the user names and passwords are currently stored in
the <config_file> in plain text.

Here is an example:

.. code:: python

    "users": {
        "admin": "Password0",
        "user1": "Password1",
        "user2": "Password2"
    }

The authorization is enabled using the python package
`flask_httpauth <https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io>`_.
Authorization could be enhanced by changing the method "decorated" using
@auth.get_password in medallion/__init__.py

We welcome contributions for other back-end plugins.
