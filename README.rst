cti-taxii-server
================

This is an `OASIS TC Open Repository <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_.
See the `Governance`_ section for more information.

Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXIIâ„¢) is an application layer
protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner.

*Medallion* is a minimal implementation of a TAXII 2.1 Server in Python.

**WARNING:** *medallion* was designed as a prototype and reference
implementation of TAXII 2.1, and is not intended for production use.

*medallion* has been designed to be a simple front-end REST server providing
access to the endpoints defined in that specification.
It uses the python framework - `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.  *medallion*
depends on back-end "plugins" which handle the persistence of the TAXII data and
metadata. The TAXII specification is agnostic to what type of data a TAXII
server stores, but this will usually be STIX 2 content.

Two back-end plugins are provided with *medallion*: the Memory back-end and the
MongoDB back-end.  The Memory back-end persists data "in memory".  It is
initialized using a json file that contains TAXII data and metadata.
It is possible to save the current state of the in memory store, but this
back-end is really intended only for testing purposes.  The MongoDB backend is
somewhat more robust and makes use of a MongoDB server, installed independently.
The MongoDB back-end can only be used if the pymongo python package is
installed. An error message will result if it is used without that package.

For more information, see `the documentation <https://medallion.readthedocs.io/>`__ on
ReadTheDocs.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install *medallion* is with pip

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install medallion

Usage
-----

As a script
-----------

Medallion provides a command-line interface to start the TAXII Server

.. code-block:: text

    usage: medallion [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--debug-mode]
                     [--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
                     [-c CONF_FILE] [--conf-dir CONF_DIR | --no-conf-dir]
                     [--conf-check] [CONFIG_PATH]

    medallion v3.0.0

    positional arguments:
      CONFIG_PATH           Deprecated argument for specifying a single
                            JSON configuration file. Do not specify this
                            and `--conf-file`.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

      --host HOST           The host to listen on.

      --port PORT           The port of the web server.

      --debug-mode          If set, start application in debug mode.

      --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                            The logging output level for medallion.

      -c CONF_FILE, --conf-file CONF_FILE
                            Path to a single configuration file. Defaults to the
                            value of the MEDALLION_CONFFILE environment variable
                            or /etc/xdg/medallion/3/medallion.conf.

      --conf-dir CONF_DIR   Path to a directory containing JSON configuration
                            files with names ending in .json or .conf. Defaults to
                            the value of the MEDALLION_CONFDIR environment
                            variable or /etc/xdg/medallion/3/config.d.

      --no-conf-dir         Disable the use of any configuration directory as
                            described for --conf-dir. This may be used to ensure
                            that the default or some value from the environment is
                            not used.

      --conf-check          Evaluate medallion configuration without running the
                            server.

To run *medallion*

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python medallion/scripts/run.py --conf-file <config-file>

Make sure medallion is using the same port that your TAXII client will be connecting on. You can specify which port medallion runs on using the `--port` option, for example

.. code-block:: bash

    $ medallion --port 80 --conf-file config_file.json

The <config_file> contains:

- configuration information for the backend plugin
- a simple user name/password dictionary

To use the Memory back-end plug, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "backend": {
            "module_class": "MemoryBackend",
            "filename": "<path to json file with initial data>"
        }
    }

To use the Mongo DB back-end plug, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code-block:: json

    {
         "backend": {
            "module_class": "MongoBackend",
            "uri": "<Mongo DB server url>  # e.g., 'mongodb://localhost:27017/'"
         }
    }

*Note: A Mongo DB should be available at some URL when using the Mongo DB back-end*

A description of the Mongo DB structure expected by the mongo db backend code is
described in `the documentation <https://medallion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mongodb_schema.html>`_.

As required by the TAXII specification, *medallion* supports HTTP Basic
authorization.  However, the user names and passwords are currently stored in
the <config_file> in plain text.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "users": {
           "admin": "Password0",
           "user1": "Password1",
           "user2": "Password2"
        }
    }

The authorization is enabled using the python package
`flask_httpauth <https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io>`_.
Authorization could be enhanced by changing the method "decorated" using
@auth.get_password in medallion/__init__.py

Scripts are also provided to run medallion through gunicorn with certificate-
based authentication:

```
MEDALLION_CONFFILE="<config_file>" gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 --log-level 'debug' --worker-class 'medallion.scripts.cert_auth_worker.CertAuthWorker' --ca-certs '<ca_cert_file>' --certfile '<certificate_file>' --keyfile '<key_file>' --cert-reqs 2 --do-handshake-on-connect "medallion.scripts.cert_auth_app:getApp()"
```

Configs may also contain a "taxii" section as well, as shown below:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "taxii": {
           "max_page_size": 100
           "interop_requirements": true
        }
    }

All TAXII servers require a config, though if any of the sections specified above
are missing, they will be filled with default values.

The ``interop_requirements`` option will enforce additional requireemnts from
the TAXII 2.1 Interoperability specification. It defaults to ``false``.

We welcome contributions for other back-end plugins.

Docker
------

We also provide a Docker image to make it easier to run *medallion*

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker build . -t medallion -f docker_utils/Dockerfile

If operating behind a proxy, add the following option (replacing `<proxy>` with
your proxy location and port): ``--build-arg https_proxy=<proxy>``.

Then run the image

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -v <directory>:/var/taxii medallion

Replace ``<directory>`` with the full path to the directory containing your
medallion configuration.
