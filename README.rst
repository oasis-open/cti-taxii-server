medallion
=========

NOTE: This is an `OASIS TC Open Repository <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_.
See the `Governance`_ section for more information.

*Medallion* is a minimal implementation of a TAXII 2.0 Server in Python.

For more information, see `the
documentation <https://medallion.readthedocs.io/>`__ on
ReadTheDocs.

**WARNING:** *medallion* was designed as a prototype and reference
implementation of TAXII 2.0, and is not intended for production use.

*medallion* has been designed to be a simple front-end REST server providing
access to the endpoints defined in that specification.
It uses the python framework - `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.  *medallion*
depends on back-end "plugins" which handle the persistence of the TAXII data and
metadata. The TAXII specification is agnostic to what type of data a TAXII
server stores, but this will usually be STIX 2 content.

Two back-end plugins are provided with *medallion*: the Memory back-end and the
MongoDB back-end.  The Memory back-end persists data "in memory".  It is
initialized using a json file that contains TAXII data and metadata.
It is possible to save the current state of the in memory store, but this
back-end is really intended only for testing purposes.  The MongoDB backend is
somewhat more robust and makes use of a MongoDB server, installed independently.
The MongoDB back-end can only be used if the pymongo python package is
installed. An error message will result if it is used without that package.


Installation
============

The easiest way to install *medallion* is with pip::

  $ pip install medallion


Usage
=====

As a script
-----------

Medallion provides a command-line interface to start the TAXII Server::

    usage: medallion [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--debug-mode]
                  [--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
                  CONFIG_PATH

    medallion v0.4.0

    positional arguments:
      CONFIG_PATH           The location of the JSON configuration file to use.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

      --host HOST           The host to listen on.

      --port PORT           The port of the web server.

      --debug-mode          If set, start application in debug mode.

      --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                            The logging output level for medallion.

To run *medallion*::

    $ python medallion/scripts/run.py <config-file>

Make sure medallion is using the same port that your TAXII client will be connecting on. You can specify which port medallion runs on using the `--port` option, for example::

    $ medallion --port 80 config_file.json

The <config_file> contains:

- configuration information for the backend STIX 2.0 data plugin
- configuration information for the backend authorization plugin
- a simple user name/password dictionary

To use the Memory backend plugin, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: json

    {
        "backend": {
            "module": "medallion.backends.taxii.memory_backend",
            "module_class": "MemoryBackend",
            "filename": "<path to json file with initial data>"
        }
    }

To use the directory features, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: json

    {
        "backend": {
            "module": "medallion.backends.taxii.memory_backend",
            "module_class": "MemoryBackend",
            "path": "<path to directory>",
            "load_from_path": true
        }
    }

A complete config can be seen in this `example <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-server/blob/master/example_configs/directory_backend_config_auth_from_file.json>`_

The backend uses the path pointed to by the path config as its root. Each directory within becomes a TAXII 2.0
api root. STIX 2.0 bundles as JSON files can be placed within the root, and the contents of each file will be aggregated
into a single collection.

To use the MongoDB backend plugin, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: json

    {
         "backend": {
            "module": "medallion.backends.taxii.mongodb_backend",
            "module_class": "MongoBackend",
            "uri": "<Mongo DB server url>  # e.g., 'mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/'"
         }
    }

*Note: A Mongo DB should be available at some URL when using the Mongo DB back-end*

A description of the Mongo DB structure expected by the mongo db STIX 2.0 data backend code is described in
`the documentation <https://medallion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mongodb_schema.html>`_.

As required by the TAXII specification, *medallion* supports HTTP Basic authorization. In addition, *medallion* supports
API Token authorization and JWT authorization. When stored in the <config-file>, passwords are encrypted.

Here is an example:

.. code:: json

    {
        "users": {
            "admin": "pbkdf2:sha256:150000$vhWiAWXq$a16882c2eaf4dbb5c55566c93ec256c189ebce855b0081f4903f09a23e8b2344",
            "user1": "pbkdf2:sha256:150000$TVpGAgEI$dd391524abb0d9107ff5949ef512c150523c388cfa6490d8556d604f90de329e",
            "user2": "pbkdf2:sha256:150000$CUo7l9Vz$3ff2da22dcb84c9ba64e2df4d1ee9f7061c1da4f8506618f53457f615178e3f3"
        },
        "api_keys": {
            "123456": "admin",
            "abcdef": "user1"
        }
    }

*Note: the plaintext passwords for the above example are:*

.. code:: json

    {
        "users": {
           "admin": "Password0",
           "user1": "Password1",
           "user2": "Password2"
        }
    }

If JWT authorization is used, a secret key is required in the config:

.. code:: json

    {
        "flask": {
            "SECRET_KEY": "CHANGE_ME"
        }
    }

A script for generating user passwords is included
`generate_user_password.py <https:medallion/scripts/generate_user_password.py>`_

The authorization is enabled using the python package
`flask_httpauth <https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io>`_.
Authorization could be enhanced by changing the method "decorated" using
@auth.get_password in medallion/__init__.py

Configs may also contain a "taxii" section as well, as shown below:

.. code:: python

    {
        "taxii": {
           "max_page_size": 100
        }
    }

All TAXII servers require a config, though if any of the sections specified above
are missing, they will be filled with default values.

The backend for authorization can also be configured in the <config-file>:

To use the Memory Authorization backend plugin, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: json

    {
        "auth": {
            "module": "medallion.backends.auth.memory_auth",
            "module_class": "AuthMemoryBackend",
            "users": {},
            "api_keys": {}
        }
    }

To use the Mongo DB Authorization backend plugin, include the following in the <config-file>:

.. code:: json

    {
        "auth": {
            "module": "medallion.backends.auth.mongodb_auth",
            "module_class": "AuthMongodbBackend",
            "uri": "mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/",
            "db_name": "auth"
        }
    }

The structure expected by the mongo db authorization backend code is:

.. code:: json

    {
        "user": {
            "_id": "user@example.com",
            "password": "pbkdf2:sha256:150000$vhWiAWXq$a16882c2eaf4dbb5c55566c93ec256c189ebce855b0081f4903f09a23e8b2344",
            "company_name": "Example Organization",
            "contact_name": "User",
            "created": "",
            "updated": ""
        },
        "api_key": {
            "_id": "<api_key>",
            "user_id": "user@example.com",
            "created": "",
            "last_used_at": "",
            "last_used_from": ""
        }
    }

A script for adding users and api-keys is included `auth_db_utils.py <https:medallion/scripts/auth_db_utils.py>`_

Multiple authorization are supported by *medallion* at the same time and can be added to the <config-file>:

.. code:: json

    {
        "multi-auth": [
            "basic",
            "api_key"
        ]
    }

Additional configurations can be seen in `example_configs <https:/example_configs>`_

We welcome contributions for other back-end plugins.

Docker
======

We also provide a Docker image to make it easier to run *medallion*::

    $ docker build . -t medallion

If operating behind a proxy, add the following option (replacing `<proxy>` with
your proxy location and port): ``--build-arg https_proxy=<proxy>``.

Then run the image::

    $ docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -v <directory>:/var/taxii medallion

Replace ``<directory>`` with the full path to the directory containing your
medallion configuration.
